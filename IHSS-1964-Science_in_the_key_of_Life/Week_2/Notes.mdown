Article 1:Sacralising the city: Sound, space and performance in Hindu ritual practices in London

It's the best time, it's the worst time. Based on the globalisation speed up by information technology, the communication between people are tending to be increasingly frequrent, and the disagreement of beliefs are toubling us all the time.

Article 2: The Singapore government's explanation for why Indian music can be banned but not Chinese.

This is the culture I refered as un-tuned culture in the previous I guess. I am not judging the culture is proper or not, and I strongly hold the point that every culture deserves highly respectation due to the contribution it does on making the world such a colorful one. However, every culture is also supposed to respect each other. As the government officer said, "Hindus have been allowed three religious foot processions: Thaipusam, Panguni Uthiram and Thimithi." They do respect Indian culture a lot, but they don't think Indian culture respects them back at same level.
