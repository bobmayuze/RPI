From Herbert Hoover's "A chicken in every pot and a car in every garage" to Obama's healthcare speech, despite their political achievements, it is quite obvious that the concentration of the majority has transformed from eliminating hunger to maintaining healthy. In modern society, it is not very likely for an individual to starve, but it is of great chance for him/her to have other diseases such as diabetes. With the advanced technology, the death rate is largely decreased, which leads to the exponential growth of population. Hospitals, the agency of saving people from suffering, are facing the huge challenge of dealing with the exponentially growing number of patients. Located in Cali, Colombia, the Valle del Lili Foundation(VLF) handled this question pretty well.

	1.	
	What aspects of the implementation and subsequent use 

On January 1st, 2011, VLF swithed from paper to electronic documents. They use SAP(Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processin) as their ERP(electronic medical records) system to re-structure the process of solving health problem for patients to further improve sevice delivery and effiency. 

Take medical orders as an example. Before they make use of SAP, all of these medical orders and clinical notes are hand-written by the doctors and nurses. Drug allergy alerts were handwritten and attached to patient's chart, which leads to a relatively high risk of missing the alert.

With the help of SAP, both doctors and nurses need to type the record into the system, whick makes the record traceablt and legible. The alert is also automatically presented on the information page, which further ensures the security of patients.
	
	What improvement of the integrated information system did VLF handle well? 

Developed in Germany, SAP was known as a brilliant ERP system for administrative and operational support processes. However, its healthcare solution was developed for less clinically complex environments and health systems that differed greatly from Colombia’s. In other words, directly applying will not fit Colombia's health system. VLF handled this problem pretty well.

While they were applying SAP to VLF, they chose a local SAP partner firm  Compunet to help VLF calibrate with SAP while the other offer was a much stronger firm with more than double exprience of software development. As Hernando, head of IT, said: "With SAP, it’s better to integrate than to develop. When you integrate, you are adjusting to what the program offers, to what is there already, and when upgrading to a new version, you have no trouble. That is not the case for software you develop yourself."

On the other hand, VLF also made a lot of efforts on communicaition about conviencing and training their staff to get used to SAP. Managers of VLF did not simply require the staff to make the change, instead, they analyze the importance of appling SAP and how it can further help the hospital to the staff, which was a relatively gentle way. VLF took the change step by step without any rush, which is another huge reason why it could be done.

	What could it have done differently?

There could be more than one way of improving their effiency, and it does not have to be done with electronicize their files. For instance, they can also re-constructure the process of dealing with patients. They can modulize the process to help doctors and nurses work together easier. They can also setup some basic logic flow for patients. In that case, patients can basicall help themselves out or settle done the real problem before they talk to docors.

	3.If you were facing a similar situation, would you choose a phased implementation or a big-bang? Discuss the pros and cons of each. 
If I were facing the similar situaion, I would like to choose the phased implementation rather than a big-bang. Both of these path have their own advantages and disadvantages. As for phased implementation, it will be easier for others to accept, however, it may take too much time, which may leads to the collapse of the hospital. As for the big-bang path, it is quite obvious that the change could be done in a short period, however, the staff may not get used to it, which may leads to worse problems such as mis-giving medical orders to patiences. Compared with the big-bang path, it is more important to make sure the security of patients.
